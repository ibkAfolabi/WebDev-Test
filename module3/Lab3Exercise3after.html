    <h4>Paul Gauguin</h4>
    <p>Eug√®ne Henri Paul Gauguin, was a French Post-Impressionist artist. 
    Unappreciated until after his death, Gauguin is now recognized for 
    his experimental use of color and Synthetist style that were 
    distinct from Impressionism. Toward the end of his life, he 
    spent ten years in French Polynesia. The paintings from this 
    time depict people or landscapes from that region.</p>
